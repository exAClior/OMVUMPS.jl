In this tutorial, we talk about the details of implementing the VUMPS(variational uniform matrix product state) algorithm for finding the ground state of a translation-invariant hamiltonian.

## Matrix Product State Representation
Since the hamiltonian has translation invariance, we would expect the ground state to be so as well. For 1D system, we may represent such ground state with a Matrix Product State. Details of such representation is explained quite well in Chapter 13 of tutorial [1].
